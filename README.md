Hello darlin, nice to see you. It's been a long time. You're just as lovely as you used to be. How's your new love? Are you happy? Hope you're doin fine. Just to know it means so much to me. What's that, darlin? How am I doin? I'm doin alright except I can't sleep, and I cry all night til dawn. What I'm trying to say is I love you, and I miss you, and I'm so sorry that I did you wrong. Look up, darlin, let me kiss you just for old time's sake. Let me hold you in my arms one more time. Thank you, darlin. May God bless you, and may each step you take bring you closer to the things you seek to find. Goodbye, darlin. Gotta go now, gotta try to find a way to lose these memories of a love so warm and true. And if you should ever find it in your heart to forgive me, come back, darlin. I'll be waitin for you...
